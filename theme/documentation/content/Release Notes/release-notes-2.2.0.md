We are planning to make several improvements in our infrastructure, which includes pull request previews and automated releases. In this regard, we have removed our standalone documentation repository from Github and moved it inside Elegant source code repository. You are going to see the result of this change in our next couple of releases.

- New: TipueSearch updated to 7.1
- New: Use `PROJECTS_TITLE` to customize project list title. (default My Projects)
- Changed: Reading Time is displayed only if it is greater than `READING_TIME_LOWER_LIMIT` variable (default 4 min)
- Changed: Project documentation has been moved inside the Elegant repository
- Removed: Google Plus
