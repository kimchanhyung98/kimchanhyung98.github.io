Readers of an article on your site usually look for other articles on the same
topic. Categories and tags are a way of showing them related articles. Elegant
displays the count of articles that you have written in a category or tag in a
non-intrusive manner.

Every category and tag has the count of articles in superscript. So if you have
written three articles in the C++ category or tag, it will have 3 in the
superscript. This way visitor will know you have written other articles too on
the same topic.

Check out the screenshots,
