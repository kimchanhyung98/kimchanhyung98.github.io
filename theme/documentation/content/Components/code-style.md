Elegant uses [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme for syntax
highlighting. Line numbers have a different background color so that they
appear distinct from the code. Here is an example

    #!c
    int sample_function (void) {
        printf ("This is a sample function");
        return 0
    }
