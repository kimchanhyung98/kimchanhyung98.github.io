Elegant follows following format for the `<title>` tag

```
Article title Â· Site Name
```

![Article title is always visible in the
tab]({static}/images/elegant-theme_page-title.png)

Some sites put site title first and article title later in the `<title>` tag.
There is a problem with this approach. When you open too many tabs, browser
delimits tab's title from the end. In such cases, only the first few words or
even letters of the `<title>` are left visible.

If visitor has opened several tabs from your website, all tabs will have "Site
Name..." title. User will need to click on each tab to identify his required
tab from the content. But with Elegant's approach article title will always be
visible, and reader will have less difficultly in identifying the tab he is
after.

Putting site title before the article title increases your site name
visibility. Elegant achieves this by putting site name in the top navigation
bar of every page, where it always stays above the fold.
