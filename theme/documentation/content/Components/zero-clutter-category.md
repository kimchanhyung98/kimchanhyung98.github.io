Pelican by default creates a separate page for each category. Themes list all
the articles filed in that category at its page. Elegant takes a different
approach which is, "all Categories but with zero clutter".

It lists all the categories and their articles on the same page. To reduce
clutter and utilize space efficiently, each category and its list of articles
is enclosed in [collapsible accordions](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#collapse).

Here is how categories appear collapsed

And this is how they appear uncollapsed

Did you notice that categories are listed in ascending alphabetical order and
articles are sorted by their date in descending order?
