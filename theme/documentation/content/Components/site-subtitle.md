You can optionally define `SITE_SUBTITLE` variable in Pelican configuration. It will appear in the footer of the site.

For example,

```python
SITESUBTITLE = "You can, you should, and if you're brave enough to start, you will."
```

It appears in the footer as

![Site subtitle]({static}/images/elegant-theme_site-subtitle.png)
